# Predictive Modeling of Water Quality Parameters for Fish Farming
## Introduction
Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms in controlled environments, is crucial for ensuring the sustainability and productivity of fish farming operations. Real-time monitoring of water parameters like turbidity, pH, and temperature is essential. This project aims to develop a predictive model to optimize fish farming practices by forecasting conditions that maximize fish production.
